Welcome to the Advanced Microservices Platform, a project born out of an insightful tutorial by [Neil Cummings](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-a-microservices-app-with-dotnet-and-nextjs-from-scratch/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING) 

## Project Overview
This initiative stems from my desire to consolidate my professional expertise in technologies like .NET and React.js. 
By combining these, I aimed to create an advanced microservices platform that not only showcases my knowledge 
but also serves as a practical solution for building sophisticated applications.

## Technologies Utilized

- .NET 8: Powers the backend microservices, providing a solid foundation for robust and efficient server-side operations.
- Next.js 14: Drives the frontend, ensuring a modern and performant user interface with the benefits of React.js.
- Docker and Kubernetes: This project serves as a hands-on learning experience for orchestrating Docker containers using Kubernetes, 
adding a layer of scalability and containerization.

## Future Plans

As the project evolves, I plan to introduce new custom functionalities, enhancing the platform's capabilities. One exciting addition on the horizon 
is the integration of the OpenAI GPT model. This addition aims to generate detailed auction descriptions based on information about specific car models, 
adding a unique and intelligent dimension to the platform.
